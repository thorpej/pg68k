The 68k Playground, a 680x0-based home-brew computer with multiple CPU options

This is a series of home-brew computers based on the Motorola 680x0 family
of CPUs.  I intend to build at least a few different flavors, ranging from
a 68000-based BASIC machine to (eventually, one of these days, maybe) a
68060-based workstation.  As a person who has spent his entire career doing
system software, this is a vehicle to learn hardware design.
